# AllPayTest

This test is solved using Visual Studio 2015.

Start the application and try to solve the game by clicking on the lights.
When you win a dialog is shown and the game shows a black board.

You can change the size of the game using the numeric up down control and clicking on reset afterwards.

The game is implemented in a DLL.
A unit test project is also added to the solution with some tests in it.
